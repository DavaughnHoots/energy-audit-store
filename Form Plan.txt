BACKEND INFORMATION:
Derived Values:
1. Monitoring Protocol:
   Based on:
   - Current capabilities
   - Preferred method
   - System complexity
   Formula: Base Protocol × Complexity Factor


2. Verification Requirements:
   Based on:
   - Improvement types
   - Investment level
   - Reporting needs


Reference Tables Needed:
1. Monitoring System Types:
   - Basic (bills): Monthly data
   - Smart meter: Hourly data
   - Real-time: Minute-by-minute
   - Sub-metering: Circuit-level


2. Success Metric Baselines:
   - Energy use: kWh/month
   - Cost: $/month
   - Carbon: kg CO2/month
   - Temperature: °F variance


3. Verification Methods:
   By improvement type:
   - HVAC: Runtime + temperature
   - Insulation: Temperature differential
   - Solar: Production monitoring
   - Lighting: Usage patterns


Calculations:
1. Energy Savings Verification:
           S = Ebefore - Eafter
   
Where:
   - Ebefore = Baseline consumption
   - Eafter = Post-improvement consumption
   Normalized for weather and occupancy


2. Cost Savings Verification:
           CS = S × Rate
   
Where:
   - S = Verified energy savings
   - Rate = Current utility rate


3. Performance Index:
           PI = Actual Savings/Predicted Savings × 100
   
Where:
   - Actual from monitoring
   - Predicted from Section 13


4. Comfort Improvement:
           CI = (T1 - T2)/T1 × 100
   
Where:
   - T1 = Initial temperature variance
   - T2 = Current temperature variance


5. ROI Verification:
           Actual ROI = (Verified Savings × Years)/Cost × 100
   
Where:
   - Verified Savings = Annual confirmed savings
   - Years = Time since implementation


6. Monitoring Score:
           MS = (Data Points × Frequency × Accuracy)/100
   
Where:
   - Data Points = Number of parameters
   - Frequency = Updates per day
   - Accuracy = Calibration factor


7. Reporting Metrics:
   
Monthly Report:
   - Energy use vs. baseline
   - Cost savings to date
   - Carbon reduction
   - Comfort metrics
   - ROI status
