# Report Summary Financial Data Integration Plan

## Problem Statement
1. The "Total Estimated Annual Savings" in the Summary tab shows incorrect/zero values despite the recommendations having accurate financial data.
2. We've already fixed the Savings Analysis chart to use accurate financial data from the product recommendation service, but the Summary section still needs to be updated.
3. We need to ensure consistency between all financial displays in the report (recommendations, charts, and summary).

## Solution Approach
We'll extend our existing solution to:

1. Calculate the total estimated savings from all recommendations after they've been enhanced with product recommendation data
2. Update `data.summary.totalEstimatedSavings` with this accurate total
3. Add logging to trace the financial data flow

## Implementation Steps

1. **Modify InteractiveReportPage.tsx**:
   - Add code after updating the chart data to calculate the total estimated savings
   - Update the summary section with the calculated total
   - Add detailed logging to verify the update

2. **Code Addition**:
   ```typescript
   // After updating chart data and recommendations
   // Calculate and update the total estimated savings for the summary
   const updatedTotalEstimatedSavings = data.recommendations.reduce(
     (sum, rec) => sum + (rec.estimatedSavings || 0),
     0
   );

   // Update the summary with accurate financial data
   if (data.summary) {
     data.summary.totalEstimatedSavings = updatedTotalEstimatedSavings;
     console.log(`Updated total estimated savings in summary to: $${updatedTotalEstimatedSavings}`);
   }
   ```

3. **Testing**:
   - Verify that the Summary tab shows the correct Total Estimated Annual Savings value
   - Ensure consistency between the recommendations, charts, and summary sections

## Benefits
- **Unified Data Source** - All financial displays (recommendations, charts, summary) will use data from the same source
- **Frontend-Only Fix** - No backend changes required, making deployment simpler
- **Improved User Experience** - Consistent financial data across the application enhances trust and usability
