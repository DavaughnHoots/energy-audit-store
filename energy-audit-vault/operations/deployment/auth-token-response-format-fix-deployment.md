# Auth Token Response Format Fix Deployment

## Overview

This deployment implements the fix for dashboard loading issues related to token refresh operations. Users have been experiencing issues loading their dashboard because of a mismatch between frontend expectations and backend response format for token refresh operations.

## Changes Summary

1. Modified the `/refresh-token` endpoint in `backend/src/routes/auth.ts` to include token values in the response body in addition to setting cookies
2. Created documentation of the issue and fix
3. Updated knowledge graph with relationships to existing auth components

## Deployment Steps

1. ✅ Create documentation in `energy-audit-vault/operations/bug-fixes/auth-token-response-format-fix.md`
2. ✅ Modify `backend/src/routes/auth.ts` refresh-token endpoint to include tokens in response body
3. ⬜ Commit changes with descriptive message
4. ⬜ Push to GitHub
5. ⬜ Deploy to Heroku

## Git Commands

```bash
# Commit changes
git add backend/src/routes/auth.ts energy-audit-vault/operations/bug-fixes/auth-token-response-format-fix.md energy-audit-vault/operations/deployment/auth-token-response-format-fix-deployment.md

git commit -m "Fix token refresh response format to include tokens in body"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin fix/auth-token-undefined-fix

# Deploy to Heroku
git push heroku fix/auth-token-undefined-fix:main
```

## Verification Steps

After deployment:

1. Open the application in a new browser session
2. Log in with valid credentials
3. Verify the dashboard loads properly
4. Check browser console for any token-related errors
5. Test the flow with developer tools open, monitoring network requests
6. Specifically verify that the `/refresh-token` response contains token values

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered:

1. Revert the commit in the GitHub repository
2. Push the reverted commit to Heroku
3. Notify the team about the rollback
