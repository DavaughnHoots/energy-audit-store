# Auth Token Field Naming Fix Deployment

## Overview

This deployment addresses the authentication issues users are experiencing when logging in and accessing dashboard data. The root cause is a field naming inconsistency in the token refresh API response where the access token field name doesn't match frontend expectations.

## Changes Summary

1. Enhanced `backend/src/routes/auth.ts` refresh token endpoint with improved validation and logging
2. Added proper error handling for the 500 server error case
3. Added detailed logging of response structure to aid troubleshooting
4. Improved token validation to prevent undefined token issues

## Deployment Checklist

- [x] Examine relevant files to identify exact naming inconsistencies
  - [x] Check `backend/src/routes/auth.ts` refresh token endpoint response
  - [x] Check `backend/src/services/userAuthService.ts` for token field naming
  - [x] Check frontend `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` for expected field names
- [x] Enhance the refresh token endpoint with validation and logging
- [x] Add error handling to prevent 500 errors
- [x] Add detailed logging of response structure
- [ ] Test login flow locally
- [ ] Commit changes to Git
- [ ] Push to GitHub
- [ ] Deploy to Heroku
- [ ] Verify fix in production environment

## Deployment Steps

```bash
# After making changes to the necessary files

# Commit changes
git add backend/src/routes/auth.ts energy-audit-vault/operations/bug-fixes/auth-token-field-naming-fix.md energy-audit-vault/operations/deployment/auth-token-field-naming-fix-deployment.md

git commit -m "Enhanced token refresh endpoint with validation and improved error handling"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin fix/auth-token-field-naming-fix

# Deploy to Heroku
git push heroku fix/auth-token-field-naming-fix:main
```

## Verification Steps

After deployment:

1. Open the application in a new browser session
2. Log in with valid credentials
3. Verify the dashboard loads properly
4. Check browser console for any token-related errors
5. Test the flow with developer tools open, monitoring network requests
6. Specifically verify that the `/refresh-token` response contains both `token` and `refreshToken` fields
7. Check the server logs for the new debugging information about token refresh structure

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered:

1. Revert the commit in the GitHub repository
2. Push the reverted commit to Heroku
3. Notify the team about the rollback
