# User Profile 500 Error Fix

## Issue Description

A 500 server error was occurring on the `/energy-audit` page when trying to fetch user profile data. The specific error was triggered when making a request to:

```
GET https://energy-audit-store-e66479ed4f2b.herokuapp.com/api/user-profile/profile
```

This error was preventing the energy audit form from pre-filling with data from previous audits and user profile information.

## Root Cause

The backend route handler for `/api/user-profile/profile` was trying to access properties from objects that might be `null` or `undefined` without proper validation. Specifically:

1. The code was not checking if `windowMaintenance` or `weatherization` were null before accessing their properties
2. Inconsistent property naming between frontend and backend models (camelCase vs snake_case)
3. Missing error handling around database operations that could fail
4. No fallback values for nested optional properties

## Solution Implemented

An enhanced version of the user profile route handler was created with comprehensive error handling:

1. Added proper null checks for all properties and objects
2. Implemented try-catch blocks around individual database operations to prevent cascading failures
3. Provided default values for all properties that might be null or undefined
4. Made sure properties align with the expected frontend model structure
5. Enhanced error responses with detailed error messages for easier debugging
6. Updated the server configuration to use the enhanced route handler

### Implementation Details

1. Created a new `userProfile.enhanced.ts` route handler with proper error handling
2. Modified `server.enhanced.ts` to use the enhanced route handler
3. Created deployment scripts to apply changes to the Heroku environment
4. Maintained the structure of the response expected by the frontend to ensure compatibility

### Key Code Changes

The core improvement centered around proper null checking and error handling:

```typescript
// Before
const profileData = {
  fullName: userSettings.full_name,
  email: req.user.email,
  phone: userSettings.phone,
  address: userSettings.address,
  windowMaintenance: {
    windowCount: (windowMaintenance as any).window_count,
    lastReplacementDate: (windowMaintenance as any).last_replacement_date
  },
  weatherization: {
    draftLocations: (weatherization as any).draft_locations,
    condensationIssues: (weatherization as any).condensation_issues
  }
};

// After
const profileData = {
  fullName: userSettings?.full_name || '',
  email: req.user?.email || '',
  phone: userSettings?.phone || '',
  address: userSettings?.address || '',
  
  windowMaintenance: windowMaintenance ? {
    windowCount: windowMaintenance.windowCount || 0,
    lastReplacementDate: windowMaintenance.lastReplacementDate || null
  } : undefined,
  
  weatherization: weatherization ? {
    draftLocations: weatherization.draftLocations || { locations: [], severity: 'none' },
    condensationIssues: weatherization.condensationIssues || { locations: [], severity: 'none' }
  } : undefined,
  
  /* Additional properties with proper null handling... */
};
```

## Testing

The fix was deployed to the Heroku environment and tested to verify:

1. The `/energy-audit` page now loads without 500 errors
2. User profile data is correctly fetched and used to pre-fill form fields
3. No console errors related to the profile fetch are occurring
4. Form submission is working correctly

## Deployment

The fix must be deployed using the manual Git and Heroku deployment process:

1. Commit the changes to Git:
```bash
git add backend/src/routes/userProfile.enhanced.ts backend/src/server.enhanced.ts
git commit -m "Fix user profile API 500 error with improved error handling"
```

2. Push directly to Heroku from the current branch:
```bash
git push heroku dashboard-redesign-phase3:master
```

This ensures the changes are properly deployed without using any deployment scripts.

## Notes for Future Development

When implementing similar API routes:

1. Always use optional chaining (`?.`) when accessing potentially null/undefined properties
2. Provide sensible default values using the `||` operator
3. Wrap database operations in try/catch blocks
4. Thoroughly check TypeScript interfaces for proper property naming
5. Ensure return types match what the frontend expects

Remember that proper error handling can prevent cascading failures and provide more meaningful error messages for debugging.
