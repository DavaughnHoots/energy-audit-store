# Property Settings Rework - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation addresses the issues with the property settings functionality:
1. Made all property settings fields optional
2. Consolidated window-related settings into the window maintenance section
3. Simplified the property details form by removing duplicate window fields

## Changes Made

### 1. TypeScript Type Updates
- Added `windowType` field to the `WindowMaintenance` interface
- Updated `UpdateWindowMaintenanceDto` to include `windowType` field

### 2. WindowMaintenanceSection Component
- Added window type selection dropdown
- Used the consolidated window type constants
- Added proper state management for the window type field

### 3. PropertyDetailsForm Component
- Removed validation that made fields required
- Removed required HTML attribute from input fields
- Removed the duplicate Windows section (moved to WindowMaintenanceSection)
- Added comment to indicate where the Windows section was moved

### 4. No Changes to the Dashboard2/PropertySettingsTab
- The existing PropertySettingsTab already had proper structure 
- Continued to use the existing component hierarchy

## Benefits
- Users can now partially fill in property details without being blocked
- Property settings are auto-populated with defaults where applicable
- Window settings are now in a single location, eliminating confusion
- User experience is improved with clearer organization of settings

## Deployment
A new deployment script (`scripts/heroku_deploy_property_settings_updates.js`) has been created to deploy these changes. This can be run using the `run-heroku-deploy-property-settings-updates.bat` file.
