# Direct Chart Integration with Product Recommendation Service

## Problem Statement
1. The Savings Analysis chart in Reports shows $1 for all recommendation bars, despite recommendations having correct financial data ($50/year, $520/year, $63/year, etc.) in the UI display.
2. Browser logs indicate "hasFinancialData: false" and "totalEstimatedSavings: 0" despite visible financial values.
3. Log shows "All savings values are zero, adding visual offset" - causing the chart to use placeholder $1 values.

## Root Cause Identified
The backend's `prepareSavingsAnalysisData()` function in `ReportGenerationService.ts` isn't extracting the financial values properly, resulting in zeros being passed to the chart component. However, the product recommendation service is correctly generating and displaying financial data in the recommendations themselves.

## Direct Integration Solution

### Approach
Instead of fixing the backend data preparation, we'll tap directly into the product recommendation service that's already working correctly:

1. **Directly use the product recommendation service** in the InteractiveReportPage component
2. **Generate chart data ourselves** using the same logic that populates the recommendations
3. **Update the chart data** before passing it to the ReportCharts component

### Implementation Steps

1. **Modify InteractiveReportPage.tsx**:
   - Import the `matchProductsToRecommendations` function from productRecommendationService
   - Call this function when report data loads to get accurate financial data
   - Create a new properly-formatted SavingsAnalysis chart dataset
   - Update the reportData.charts.savingsAnalysis with these accurate values
   - Add detailed debugging logs to confirm data flow

2. **Test in browser**:
   - Verify that the chart now shows proper financial values
   - Ensure Y-axis scales appropriately
   - Confirm tooltip values match the recommendation values

### Benefits
- **No backend changes needed** - all fixes happen on the frontend
- **Consistent data sources** - both recommendation display and chart use the same data source
- **Simplified code path** - direct connection between data generation and visualization
- **Long-term maintainability** - changes to product recommendation will automatically reflect in charts

### Testing Strategy
1. Verify chart displays actual values ($50, $520, etc.) instead of $1
2. Check that Y-axis scales properly with different value magnitudes
3. Confirm tooltips show correct currency formatting with actual values
