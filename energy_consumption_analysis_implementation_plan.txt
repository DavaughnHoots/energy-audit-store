# Energy Consumption Analysis Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Energy Consumption Analysis feature, which is the next phase of our Energy Audit Tool implementation.

## Overview

The Energy Consumption Analysis feature will enhance our energy audit tool by providing more detailed analysis of users' energy consumption patterns. This feature will allow users to:

1. Input utility bill information
2. Track energy usage over time
3. View detailed breakdowns of consumption by category
4. Identify patterns and anomalies in energy usage
5. Receive personalized recommendations based on consumption patterns

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Database Structure

We will add the following table to store energy consumption data:

**energy_consumption_records**
- id (UUID, PK)
- user_id (UUID, FK to users)
- property_id (UUID, FK to user_settings.property_details)
- record_date (Date)
- electricity_usage (Numeric) - in kWh
- gas_usage (Numeric) - in therms
- water_usage (Numeric) - in gallons
- electricity_cost (Numeric)
- gas_cost (Numeric)
- water_cost (Numeric)
- heating_degree_days (Numeric)
- cooling_degree_days (Numeric)
- weather_data (JSONB) - temperature, humidity, etc.
- created_at (Timestamp)
- updated_at (Timestamp)

### 2. Backend Services

#### 2.1 Energy Consumption Service

Create a new service in `backend/src/services/energyConsumptionService.ts` to handle:

- Processing and storing utility bill data
- Calculating energy usage metrics
- Analyzing consumption patterns
- Generating usage reports
- Forecasting future consumption
- Detecting anomalies in usage patterns

#### 2.2 Weather Data Integration

- Integrate with weather data APIs to correlate energy usage with weather patterns
- Calculate heating and cooling degree days
- Normalize energy consumption based on weather conditions

#### 2.3 API Endpoints

Create the following API endpoints:

1. `POST /api/energy-consumption/records` - Add new consumption records
2. `GET /api/energy-consumption/records` - Retrieve consumption records
3. `GET /api/energy-consumption/analysis` - Get consumption analysis
4. `GET /api/energy-consumption/forecast` - Get consumption forecast
5. `GET /api/energy-consumption/comparison` - Compare consumption to benchmarks
6. `GET /api/energy-consumption/recommendations` - Get efficiency recommendations based on consumption

### 3. Frontend Components

#### 3.1 Energy Consumption Dashboard

Create a new section in the user dashboard for energy consumption data:

- Historical consumption charts
- Bill entry interface
- Usage breakdown by category
- Trend analysis visualizations
- Weather correlation displays
- Efficiency recommendations

#### 3.2 Data Entry Forms

Create forms for inputting:

- Utility bill information
- Energy usage details
- Property occupancy changes
- Major appliance additions/removals

#### 3.3 Visualization Components

Develop visualization components for:

- Monthly usage trends
- Year-over-year comparisons
- Weather-normalized consumption
- Usage by category (heating, cooling, lighting, appliances)
- Cost breakdown charts
- Savings opportunity visualizations

## Analysis Algorithms

### 1. Baseline Calculation

Develop algorithms to:

- Establish baseline energy consumption
- Account for seasonal variations
- Normalize for property size and occupancy
- Compare to similar properties

### 2. Pattern Recognition

Implement pattern recognition to:

- Identify usage spikes
- Detect seasonal patterns
- Flag unusual consumption
- Identify opportunities for load shifting

### 3. Forecasting

Create forecasting models to:

- Predict future energy costs
- Estimate savings from efficiency improvements
- Project ROI for recommended upgrades
- Model impact of behavioral changes

## Integration with Existing Features

### 1. Connection to Energy Audit Process

- Use audit data to improve consumption analysis
- Update audit recommendations based on consumption patterns
- Pre-fill audit forms with consumption history

### 2. Product Recommendation Enhancement

- Use consumption patterns to refine product recommendations
- Prioritize products that address highest usage categories
- Calculate ROI based on actual consumption patterns

### 3. Report Generation Enhancement

- Include consumption analysis in generated reports
- Add year-over-year comparison charts
- Show potential savings based on consumption patterns
