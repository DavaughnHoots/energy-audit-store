# Property Settings Rework - Implementation Summary

## Overview

We're reworking the Property Settings feature to improve user experience by:

1. Auto-populating Property Settings with defaults from audit data
2. Integrating Property Settings directly into the Dashboard as a tab
3. Clarifying navigation between different settings pages
4. Removing the Property tab from the User Settings page

## Key Files Created

1. **Implementation Plan**: `property-settings-rework-implementation-plan.md`
   - Detailed checklist for implementation across 5 phases
   - Development approach and deployment strategy

2. **Documentation**: `energy-audit-vault/operations/enhancements/property-settings-rework.md`
   - Technical documentation with component diagrams
   - Data flow explanations
   - Implementation considerations

3. **Component Template**: `src/components/dashboard2/PropertySettingsTab.tsx.stub`
   - Starter implementation of the new tab component
   - Includes all necessary API connections and UI elements
   - Ready to be renamed to `.tsx` when implementation begins

4. **Deployment Scripts**:
   - `scripts/heroku_deploy_property_settings_rework.js`
   - `run-heroku-deploy-property-settings-rework.bat`

## Next Steps

To begin implementation, the development team should:

1. Review the `property-settings-rework-implementation-plan.md` checklist
2. Start with Phase 1 (Auto-populate Property Settings with Audit Defaults)
3. Rename `PropertySettingsTab.tsx.stub` to `PropertySettingsTab.tsx` and integrate it
4. Follow the phased approach outlined in the implementation plan

## Implementation Recommendations

For the most effective implementation:

1. **Start with Auto-Population Logic**: This immediately fixes the blocking issue where users can't access their dashboard.

2. **Test thoroughly between phases**: The changes to navigation and routing should be carefully tested to avoid broken user flows.

3. **Consider A/B testing**: For the new tab-based property settings approach, to verify it improves user experience.

4. **Update User Documentation**: As the navigation will change significantly, ensure user documentation is updated accordingly.

## Expected Outcomes

After implementation, we expect:

- Improved first-time user experience with dashboard access
- More intuitive access to property settings from within the dashboard
- Clearer separation between user and property settings
- Reduced friction in the user onboarding flow
