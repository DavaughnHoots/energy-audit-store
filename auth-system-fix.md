# Authentication System Fix: Session-Token Mismatch

## Issue

The application is experiencing a 401 Unauthorized error when attempting to generate PDF reports. This is due to a mismatch between token generation and validation:

- When a user logs in or registers, the access token is not stored in the sessions table
- The validateToken middleware checks for the token in the sessions table
- This causes authentication to fail for endpoints protected by validateToken, including PDF generation

## Solution: Store Access Tokens in Sessions Table

We will modify the UserAuthService to store access tokens in the sessions table when they're generated. This will ensure that the validateToken middleware can find and validate the tokens.

## Changes to Implement

1. Modify UserAuthService.ts:
   - Update registerUser method to store access token in sessions table
   - Update loginUser method to store access token in sessions table
   - Update refreshToken method to store new access token in sessions table
   - Update logout method to remove access token from sessions table

2. Create sessions table in the database:
   - The sessions table was missing from the database
   - Created the table with the following structure:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sessions (
         token TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
         user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
         created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
         expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL
     );
     ```

3. Add missing chart.js dependency:
   - After fixing the authentication issue, we encountered a 500 error in PDF generation
   - The backend was missing the chart.js dependency needed for report generation
   - Added chart.js to backend/package.json

## Testing

After implementing these changes, we will test:
- User registration
- User login
- Token refresh
- PDF report generation
- User logout
