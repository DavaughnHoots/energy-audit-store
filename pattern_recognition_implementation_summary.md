# Pattern Recognition Enhancements - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of enhanced pattern recognition capabilities for the Energy Consumption Analysis feature, specifically the Day 1 deliverables from the [Pattern Recognition & Forecasting Implementation Plan](pattern_recognition_forecasting_implementation_plan.txt). These enhancements provide more sophisticated time-series analysis functions to detect trends, cyclical patterns, and anomalies in energy consumption data.

## New Functions

### Trend Change Point Detection
```typescript
export function detectTrendChangePoints(
  data: TimeSeriesPoint[], 
  windowSize: number = 5, 
  thresholdMultiplier: number = 2.0
): TimeSeriesPoint[]
```
This function identifies points in time-series data where the trend direction changes significantly. It uses a moving window regression analysis and statistical thresholds to detect meaningful changes rather than noise.

### Autocorrelation Analysis
```typescript
export function calculateAutocorrelation(data: TimeSeriesPoint[], lag: number): number
```
This function calculates the correlation between a time series and a delayed version of itself (lagged by a specific number of time periods). It helps identify repeating patterns in the data, such as daily, weekly, or seasonal cycles.

### Cyclical Pattern Detection
```typescript
export function findCyclicalPatterns(
  data: TimeSeriesPoint[], 
  maxPeriod?: number, 
  significanceThreshold: number = 0.3
): CyclicalPattern[]
```
This algorithm automatically detects periodic patterns in energy consumption data and returns them sorted by significance. It can identify multiple overlapping cycles (e.g., daily, weekly, and monthly patterns) and provides metadata about each detected pattern.

### Enhanced Trend Analysis
```typescript
function calculateEnhancedTrend(data: TimeSeriesPoint[]): string
```
An improved trend detection algorithm that uses linear regression slopes to determine if consumption is increasing, decreasing, or stable over time. The enhanced algorithm normalizes the slope by the average consumption value to provide better context for the trend.

## User Benefits

These enhancements deliver several key benefits to users:

1. **More Accurate Pattern Detection**
   - The system can now identify subtle patterns that might be missed with simpler methods
   - Multiple overlapping patterns can be detected simultaneously (e.g., both weekly and monthly cycles)

2. **Better Anomaly Detection**
   - Improved contextual understanding of what constitutes "normal" consumption
   - More accurate flagging of unusual energy usage events

3. **Enhanced Behavioral Insights**
   - Detection of weekday vs. weekend usage patterns to identify behavioral habits
   - Automatic recognition of cyclical patterns helps users understand their consumption rhythms

4. **More Targeted Recommendations**
   - Pattern recognition enables more personalized energy-saving recommendations
   - Recommendations can target specific usage patterns (e.g., reducing peak consumption)

## Technical Performance

- All algorithms are optimized to work with limited data (minimum 4-8 data points)
- Fall-back mechanisms ensure graceful degradation when insufficient data is available
- Performance is maintained even with larger datasets (tested with 24+ months of data)

## Next Steps

The next phase of implementation will focus on:

1. **Seasonal Pattern Recognition** (Day 2)
   - Implementing time series decomposition
   - Adding multi-scale seasonality detection

2. **Day/Night and Weekday/Weekend Pattern Analysis** (Day 3)
   - Further enhancing time-of-day analysis
   - Improving day-of-week pattern detection

3. **Anomaly Detection Enhancements** (Day 4)
   - Implementing IQR-based outlier detection
   - Adding root cause analysis hints

## Sample Result

Here's a simplified example of the enhanced pattern detection output:

```json
{
  "seasonal": {
    "electricity": 0.72,
    "gas": 0.85,
    "water": 0.32,
    "hasSeasonality": true
  },
  "cyclicalPatterns": {
    "electricity": [
      {
        "period": 7,
        "strength": 0.68,
        "phase": 0,
        "description": "Weekly cycle"
      },
      {
        "period": 30,
        "strength": 0.42,
        "phase": 1,
        "description": "Monthly cycle"
      }
    ],
    "gas": [
      {
        "period": 365,
        "strength": 0.91,
        "phase": 0,
        "description": "Annual (yearly) cycle"
      }
    ],
    "water": []
  },
  "trendChangePoints": {
    "electricity": [
      { "date": "2025-01-15T00:00:00.000Z", "value": 148 }
    ],
    "gas": [],
    "water": []
  },
  "weekdayWeekend": {
    "available": true,
    "ratio": 1.32,
    "weekdayHeavy": true
  },
  "trend": {
    "electricity": "increasing",
    "gas": "decreasing",
    "water": "stable",
    "overallTrend": "stable"
  }
}
```

This enhanced pattern information greatly improves the system's ability to provide accurate insights and forecasts, ultimately helping users optimize their energy consumption more effectively.
