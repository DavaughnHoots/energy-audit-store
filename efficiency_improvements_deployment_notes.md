# Efficiency Score Calculation Improvements
**Deployment Notes - March 25, 2025**

## Overview

This update addresses critical issues with the efficiency score calculation in energy audit reports:
- Fixed unrealistically low efficiency scores (scores now range from 60-95%)
- Implemented property age adjustment to consider building age in scoring
- Fixed negative HVAC efficiency gap values
- Added comprehensive validation for all efficiency metrics

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Efficiency Score Service Updates

The `efficiencyScoreService.ts` file has been enhanced with:

- **Property Age Adjustment**: Added a new adjustment factor that gives newer buildings a slight bonus and older buildings a slight penalty in the efficiency score calculation. This reflects the reality that newer buildings typically have better baseline efficiency.

- **Score Range Enforcement**: Modified overall score calculation to always produce values between 60-95%, preventing unrealistically low scores that confuse users.

- **Validation Framework**: Added robust validation functions to ensure all component scores and the overall score stay within reasonable ranges.

### 2. HVAC Efficiency Gap Fix

The `HvacCalculator.ts` component has been updated to:

- **Normalize Efficiency Values**: Added intelligent normalization for different HVAC system types:
  - Heat pumps (HSPF scale)
  - Furnaces (AFUE percentage)
  - Central AC (SEER values)

- **Positive Gap Enforcement**: Fixed the critical issue where efficiency gaps could be negative (like -155%) by enforcing positive gap values.

- **Efficiency Normalization**: Added handling for abnormally high efficiency values (like 250) that were causing calculation errors.

### 3. Testing

Created comprehensive test script `test-efficiency-score-improvements.js` covering:
- Property age adjustment calculations
- HVAC efficiency gap calculations with diverse test cases
- Efficiency metrics validation with edge cases

## How to Verify

1. Run the test script:
   ```
   node test-efficiency-score-improvements.js
   ```

2. Check for low/negative values in generated reports:
   - Overall Efficiency Score should always be 60-95%
   - HVAC efficiency gap should always be positive
   - Component scores should be reasonable values

## Expected Impact

These changes will immediately improve report quality by:
- Eliminating unrealistic efficiency scores (previously as low as 40%)
- Preventing negative HVAC gap values (-155% in some reports)
- Providing contextually appropriate scores based on building age
- Adding safeguards against other potential calculation anomalies

## Next Steps

1. Complete the implementation of efficiency score context in reports
2. Enhance report visualization with color-coded indicators
3. Add more comprehensive baseline comparisons

## Technical Considerations

- The efficiency interpretation function remains unchanged
- Default values are provided in cases of missing or invalid data
- Service maintains backward compatibility with existing API contracts
