# Analytics Tracking and Diagnostics Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to enhance the analytics tracking system for the Energy Audit application. The plan addresses two key issues:

1. **Missing Page View Events**: Currently, many pages (including the Community page) don't track page views, resulting in incomplete analytics data.
2. **Limited Dashboard Data**: The Most Visited Pages and Most Used Features sections in the admin dashboard aren't updating properly due to insufficient tracking implementation.

## Implementation Checklist

### 1. Page Tracking Implementation

- [ ] **Audit Current State**
  - [ ] Identify all page components in the application
  - [ ] Check which pages already implement `usePageTracking`
  - [ ] Create list of pages missing tracking

- [ ] **Add `usePageTracking` Hook to Pages**
  - [ ] Add to CommunityPage (`usePageTracking('community')`)
  - [ ] Add to EducationPage (`usePageTracking('education')`)
  - [ ] Add to UserSettingsPage (`usePageTracking('settings')`)
  - [ ] Add to InteractiveReportPage (`usePageTracking('reports')`)
  - [ ] Verify UserDashboardPage tracking is working (`usePageTracking('dashboard')`)
  - [ ] Add to ProductsPage (`usePageTracking('products')`)
  - [ ] Add to any other missing page components

- [ ] **Enhance Page Tracking Hook**
  - [ ] Add more detailed path information
  - [ ] Include better error handling
  - [ ] Add debug mode logging

### 2. Component Tracking Implementation

- [ ] **Identify Key Interactive Components**
  - [ ] List all interactive components that should be tracked
  - [ ] Prioritize high-value components for tracking

- [ ] **Add `useComponentTracking` Hooks**
  - [ ] Add to navigation components
  - [ ] Add to interactive cards/panels
  - [ ] Add to tabs and tab panels
  - [ ] Add to buttons in high-traffic areas
  - [ ] Add to modal dialogs and overlays

- [ ] **Track Specific Component Events**
  - [ ] Track button clicks
  - [ ] Track tab changes
  - [ ] Track expansion/collapse of panels
  - [ ] Track dropdown selections
  - [ ] Track media interactions

### 3. Form Tracking Implementation

- [ ] **Identify Critical Forms**
  - [ ] List all forms in the application
  - [ ] Prioritize forms based on importance

- [ ] **Add `useFormTracking` Hooks**
  - [ ] Add to EnergyAuditForm
  - [ ] Add to LoginForm/RegisterForm
  - [ ] Add to PropertyDetailsForm
  - [ ] Add to other important forms

- [ ] **Track Form Interactions**
  - [ ] Track field focus/blur
  - [ ] Track field changes
  - [ ] Track validation errors
  - [ ] Track form submissions
  - [ ] Track submission success/failure

### 4. Enhanced Admin Dashboard Diagnostics

- [ ] **Expand Debugging Tools Section**
  - [ ] Create expandable diagnostics panel
  - [ ] Add multiple diagnostic tool options

- [ ] **Analytics Status Summary**
  - [ ] Add event type distribution chart
  - [ ] Show event success/failure rates
  - [ ] Display total tracked pages/components
  - [ ] Show real-time event counter

- [ ] **Event Monitor Component**
  - [ ] Display recent events with details
  - [ ] Show current event buffer
  - [ ] Add filtering options
  - [ ] Add export capability

- [ ] **Page Hook Checker Tool**
  - [ ] Create interface to check tracking on pages
  - [ ] Show which hooks are implemented
  - [ ] Provide missing hook suggestions

- [ ] **Query Analyzer**
  - [ ] Show SQL queries used in dashboard
  - [ ] Display query performance metrics
  - [ ] Add query parameter testing tool

### 5. Backend Enhancements

- [ ] **Analytics API Improvements**
  - [ ] Add detailed logging in routes
  - [ ] Enhance error handling and reporting
  - [ ] Add performance monitoring

- [ ] **SQL Query Optimization**
  - [ ] Optimize dashboard queries
  - [ ] Add indexes for better performance
  - [ ] Add better date range filtering

- [ ] **Diagnostic Endpoints**
  - [ ] Create endpoint for raw event queries
  - [ ] Add endpoint for hook status checking
  - [ ] Create endpoint for admin diagnostics

### 6. Deployment and Testing

- [ ] **Create Test Environment**
  - [ ] Set up environment to test analytics
  - [ ] Create sample data generator

- [ ] **Deployment Scripts**
  - [ ] Create deployment script for analytics updates
  - [ ] Add rollback capability
  - [ ] Add verification steps

- [ ] **Production Verification**
  - [ ] Verify events are recording correctly
  - [ ] Check dashboard is displaying data properly
  - [ ] Monitor server performance

## Phased Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Basic Page Tracking
1. Add `usePageTracking` to all missing pages
2. Enhance the diagnostics in the admin dashboard
3. Deploy and verify page tracking is working

### Phase 2: Component Tracking
1. Add `useComponentTracking` to key interactive elements
2. Update the direct-admin endpoints to properly extract feature usage
3. Deploy and verify component tracking is updating the dashboard

### Phase 3: Form Tracking and Advanced Diagnostics
1. Add `useFormTracking` to important forms
2. Implement advanced diagnostic tools
3. Complete any remaining tracking implementation
4. Final deployment and verification

## Troubleshooting Strategy

1. Use the enhanced diagnostics to identify missing events
2. Check for console errors related to analytics
3. Verify API endpoints are receiving and processing events
4. Confirm database is storing events correctly
5. Check dashboard queries are returning expected results
