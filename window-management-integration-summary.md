# Window Management Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation addresses the request to combine the Windows Assessment and Window Maintenance functionality into a single, unified interface. This consolidation creates a more intuitive user experience by grouping all window-related settings together.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New WindowManagementSection Component
- Developed a new `WindowManagementSection` component that combines:
  - Window maintenance functionality (count, type, maintenance dates, notes)
  - Window assessment functionality (condensation issues, draft locations)
- Implemented a tabbed interface to switch between "Window Details" and "Window Assessment"
- Ensured all fields remain optional to allow users to fill in only what they know

### 2. TypeScript Updates
- Updated the WindowMaintenance interface to include the windowType field
- Ensured UpdateWindowMaintenanceDto properly exposes the windowType parameter

### 3. Simplified PropertyDetailsForm
- Removed the duplicate window-related fields section from PropertyDetailsForm
- Added a clear comment indicating where the window section was moved to

### 4. Updated PropertySettingsTab
- Modified to use the new WindowManagementSection component
- Configured the component to receive both windowData and weatherizationData
- Set up proper handlers for saving both types of window-related data

### 5. Improved UI Organization
- Added visual improvements for better section distinction:
  - Tab controls for switching between details and assessment
  - Styled card sections for different types of window assessment issues
  - Two-column layout for form fields where appropriate
  - Clear headings and labels

## Benefits
- Simplified user experience with a single location for all window-related settings
- Reduced confusion by eliminating duplicate fields and sections
- More logical organization of related settings
- Clearer distinction between window details and assessment data
- Smoother interaction with the tabbed interface
- All fields optional, allowing users to provide only the information they know

## Further Improvements
Potential future enhancements to consider:
- Implement saving of weatherization data to the backend
- Add validation for field formats (while keeping fields optional)
- Provide tooltips or help text to explain assessment criteria
- Add visual indicators for severe window issues
