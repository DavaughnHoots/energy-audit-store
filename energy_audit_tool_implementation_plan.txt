## 9. NOTES AND CONSIDERATIONS

- The Python tool uses numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for calculations and visualizations. We'll need to implement equivalent functionality in JavaScript or use server-side processing.
- The product recommendation system requires a comprehensive product database. We'll need to ensure this data is available and properly formatted.
- The visualization generation may require additional libraries on the frontend or backend.
- The financial analysis calculations should be validated against the Python implementation to ensure consistency.
- Consider performance implications of more complex calculations, especially for larger datasets.
