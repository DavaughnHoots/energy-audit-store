# Energy Audit Tool Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing the energy audit tool functionality from the Python script into our web application.

## Phase 1: Data Structure and Database Updates (Completed)

1. ✅ Analyze the Python energy_audit_tool.py to identify all required data fields
2. ✅ Create a comprehensive data requirements document
3. ✅ Update the TypeScript interfaces in energyAudit.ts to include all required fields
4. ✅ Add ProductPreferences interface to support product recommendations
5. ✅ Create database migration to add product_preferences column to energy_audits table
6. ✅ Update EnergyAuditService to handle the new product_preferences data

## Phase 2: Frontend Form Updates (Completed)

1. ✅ Add ProductPreferencesForm component to collect user preferences
2. ✅ Update EnergyAuditForm to include the new form step
3. ✅ Update FormProgressIndicator to show the new step
4. ✅ Update form validation to validate product preferences
5. ✅ Test the form flow to ensure all data is collected correctly
   - Created test files for ProductPreferencesForm component
   - Created test files for EnergyAuditForm to test the complete form flow
   - Added documentation for form testing

## Phase 3: Calculation and Recommendation Engine

1. ✅ Port the Python calculation functions to TypeScript
   - Energy usage calculations
   - Cost savings calculations
   - ROI calculations
   - Payback period calculations
   - Implemented modular architecture with specialized services
   - See `energy_audit_calculation_implementation.txt` for detailed implementation
2. ✅ Implement product recommendation algorithm
   - Match user preferences with product database
   - Filter by budget constraints
   - Sort by energy efficiency and ROI
3. ✅ Update ReportGenerationService to include product recommendations in reports

## Phase 4: API and Integration

1. ✅ Create new API endpoints for product recommendations
   - GET /api/recommendations/products?auditId={id}
   - GET /api/recommendations/products/categories
   - GET /api/recommendations/products/features
2. ✅ Update energyAudit routes to handle product preferences
   - Updated EnergyAuditService.updateAudit method to properly handle product preferences
   - Updated report generation route to include product preferences in transformed audit data
3. ✅ Integrate with product database for real-time recommendations

## Phase 5: UI for Recommendations

1. ✅ Create ProductRecommendationsPage component
   - Implemented responsive UI for displaying product recommendations
   - Created product cards with key information display
2. ✅ Implement filtering and sorting UI for recommendations
   - Added filtering by category, features, and price range
   - Implemented sorting by price, energy efficiency, ROI, and payback period
   - Added reset filters functionality
3. ⬜ Add product comparison feature
4. ⬜ Create detailed product view with energy savings information

## Phase 6: Testing and Deployment

1. ✅ Write unit tests for calculation functions
   - Created comprehensive test script for calculation services
   - Implemented test fixtures with sample data
   - Added verification of calculation results against expected values
   - Created test runner scripts for Windows and Unix systems
   - Added documentation in energy_audit_calculation_testing.md
2. ⬜ Write integration tests for recommendation engine
3. ⬜ Perform end-to-end testing of the entire flow
4. ⬜ Deploy database migrations to production
5. ⬜ Deploy updated application to production

## Phase 7: Analytics and Optimization

1. ⬜ Implement tracking for recommendation conversions
2. ⬜ Analyze user interaction with recommendations
3. ⬜ Optimize recommendation algorithm based on user behavior
4. ⬜ Implement A/B testing for different recommendation strategies

## Timeline

- Phase 1: Completed
- Phase 2: Completed
- Phase 3: Completed
- Phase 4: Completed
- Phase 5: March 26-31, 2025
- Phase 6: April 1-5, 2025
- Phase 7: April 6-15, 2025

## Resources Required

- Frontend Developer: 1 full-time
- Backend Developer: 1 full-time
- Database Administrator: 0.5 full-time (for migrations and optimization)
- QA Engineer: 1 full-time (during testing phases)
- Product Manager: 0.5 full-time (for requirements and coordination)

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Risk**: Complex calculations may not translate well from Python to TypeScript
   **Mitigation**: Start with simple calculations and gradually add complexity, with thorough testing at each step

2. **Risk**: Database performance issues with large product catalog
   **Mitigation**: Implement proper indexing and pagination for product recommendations

3. **Risk**: User experience issues with longer form flow
   **Mitigation**: Implement save/resume functionality and progress indicators

4. **Risk**: Integration with external product APIs may be unreliable
   **Mitigation**: Implement caching and fallback mechanisms for product data
