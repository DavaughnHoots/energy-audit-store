# Energy Audit Tool Implementation Plan

This document outlines the steps needed to fully implement the functionality from energy_audit_tool.py into our web application. The implementation is divided into several phases to ensure a smooth integration.

## Phase 1: Database Schema Updates

1. **Add New Fields to Energy Audit Tables**
   - Update the `energy_audits` table to include new fields for extended data
   - Add support for lighting fixtures as a JSON array in the `current_conditions` column
   - Add support for lighting patterns in the `current_conditions` column
   - Add new fields to the `heating_cooling` column for extended HVAC data
   - Add new fields to the `energy_consumption` column for extended energy data

2. **Create Visualization Data Table**
   - Create a new table `visualization_data` to store chart data and visualization outputs
   - Schema should include:
     - `id` (UUID, primary key)
     - `audit_id` (UUID, foreign key to energy_audits)
     - `visualization_type` (VARCHAR)
     - `data` (JSONB)
     - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)

3. **Migration Script**
   - Create a migration script to apply these schema changes
   - Include default values for existing records

## Phase 2: Backend Service Updates

1. **Create Extended Types**
   - Create `energyAuditExtended.ts` with extended types for the new data fields
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing types

2. **Implement Extended Calculation Service**
   - Create `extendedCalculationService.ts` to implement the advanced calculations from energy_audit_tool.py
   - Include methods for:
     - Comprehensive energy analysis
     - Detailed lighting calculations
     - Advanced HVAC efficiency calculations
     - ROI and payback period calculations
     - Carbon footprint calculations

3. **Update Energy Audit Service**
   - Modify `EnergyAuditService.ts` to use the extended calculation service
   - Add methods to convert standard audit data to extended format
   - Enhance recommendation generation to use detailed lighting data
   - Implement fallback to basic calculations if extended data is not available

4. **Enhance Report Generation Service**
   - Update `ReportGenerationService.ts` to include detailed lighting analysis in PDF reports
   - Add efficiency metrics and potential savings calculations
   - Include visualization of lighting usage patterns

5. **Create Visualization Service**
   - Implement `visualizationService.ts` to generate and store visualization data
   - Support various chart types (bar, pie, line) for different metrics
   - Include methods to retrieve and format visualization data for the frontend

## Phase 3: Frontend Updates

1. **Update Energy Audit Form Components**
   - Enhance `LightingForm.tsx` to collect detailed lighting fixture data
   - Update `HVACForm.tsx` to collect extended HVAC data
   - Update `EnergyUseForm.tsx` to collect extended energy consumption data
   - Add validation for new fields

2. **Create Visualization Components**
   - Implement chart components for various visualization types
   - Create dashboard widgets to display energy metrics
   - Add interactive elements to explore energy data

3. **Update Audit Report Page**
   - Enhance the report page to display detailed lighting analysis
   - Add visualization of energy usage patterns
   - Include interactive elements to explore recommendations

## Phase 4: API Routes and Integration

1. **Create Visualization API Routes**
   - Implement `visualization.ts` routes to handle visualization data
   - Add endpoints for generating and retrieving visualizations

2. **Update Energy Audit Routes**
   - Enhance `energyAudit.ts` routes to handle extended audit data
   - Add validation for new fields

3. **Implement Data Export/Import**
   - Add functionality to export audit data in various formats (CSV, JSON)
   - Support importing data from external sources

## Phase 5: Testing and Validation

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Create tests for extended calculation service
   - Test visualization service
   - Validate recommendation generation with various input scenarios

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test end-to-end flow from form submission to report generation
   - Validate visualization data generation and display
   - Test with various device types and screen sizes

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Benchmark calculation performance with large datasets
   - Optimize database queries for visualization data
   - Ensure responsive UI with complex visualizations

## Phase 6: Deployment and Monitoring

1. **Database Migration**
   - Run migration scripts on production database
   - Verify data integrity after migration

2. **Phased Rollout**
   - Deploy backend changes first
   - Roll out frontend changes incrementally
   - Monitor for errors and performance issues

3. **User Feedback Collection**
   - Implement feedback mechanism for new features
   - Track usage patterns of new visualization tools
   - Collect data on recommendation effectiveness

## Timeline

- Phase 1: 1 week
- Phase 2: 2 weeks
- Phase 3: 2 weeks
- Phase 4: 1 week
- Phase 5: 1 week
- Phase 6: 1 week

Total estimated time: 8 weeks

## Resources Required

- Backend developer: 1 full-time
- Frontend developer: 1 full-time
- Database administrator: 0.5 full-time
- QA tester: 0.5 full-time
- UX designer: 0.5 full-time
