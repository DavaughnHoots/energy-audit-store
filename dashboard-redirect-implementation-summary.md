# Dashboard Redirect Implementation Summary

**Date:** April 7, 2025

## Overview

This implementation redirects users from the original dashboard URL (`/dashboard`) to the new dashboard (`/dashboard2`), making the redesigned dashboard the primary user experience.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Frontend Routing Changes

Modified the React Router configuration in `App.tsx` to add a redirect from `/dashboard` to `/dashboard2`:

```typescript
// In App.tsx
<Route
  path="/dashboard"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <Navigate to="/dashboard2" replace />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
/>
```

The `replace` option ensures that the redirect won't add a new entry to the browser's history stack, making the back button function correctly.

### 2. Documentation Updates

Updated the following documentation:

- Modified `energy-audit-vault/frontend/pages/UserDashboardPage.md` to mark it as deprecated and document the redirect
- Created `energy-audit-vault/frontend/pages/NewUserDashboardPage.md` to document the new primary dashboard

### 3. Deployment Scripts

Created deployment script and batch file for the dashboard redirect:
- `scripts/heroku_deploy_dashboard_redirect.js`
- `run-heroku-deploy-dashboard-redirect.bat`

The deployment process:
1. Creates a `dashboard-redirect` branch if it doesn't exist
2. Commits the App.tsx changes to the branch
3. Pushes to GitHub
4. Deploys to Heroku

## Technical Considerations

1. **Backward Compatibility**: The redirect approach maintains backward compatibility with any existing links to `/dashboard` that users may have saved or that may exist in emails.

2. **Performance**: Using React Router's `Navigate` component ensures the redirect happens client-side without an unnecessary server round-trip.

3. **User Experience**: The redirect is seamless and doesn't disrupt the user flow. The browser URL updates to `/dashboard2` automatically.

## Verification Steps

To verify the successful deployment of this change:

1. Navigate to `https://energy-audit-store-e66479ed4f2b.herokuapp.com/dashboard`
2. Confirm the browser automatically redirects to `https://energy-audit-store-e66479ed4f2b.herokuapp.com/dashboard2`
3. Verify that the new dashboard components load correctly
4. Test navigation between different parts of the application to ensure all links work properly

## Future Considerations

In the future, we may consider:

1. Renaming `/dashboard2` to `/dashboard` once users have had time to adjust to the new dashboard
2. Updating any documentation or external references to point directly to the new dashboard URL
3. Monitoring analytics to ensure the redirect is functioning correctly for all users
