**Key Improvements:**
- Added sophisticated savings estimation based on recommendation type and property size
- Added cost estimation with square footage-based calculations
- Added scope coverage factor to adjust estimates for partial-home recommendations
- Added isEstimated flag to indicate when values are system-generated estimates
